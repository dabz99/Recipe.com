# Recipe Project
This shows a recipe website which was done during my internship at **Danisoft Inovations**. 

With the help of my instructor [ Mr. Okoroafor Collins](https://www.github.com/collinsduzzy) I was able to make it using *HTML and Materialize CSS* during the course of my training.

You can check out the code at [ Recipe.com](https://www.github.com/dabz99). By clicking the link you can see the step by step procedure taken to make this project.
